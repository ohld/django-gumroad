# django-gumroad
Gumroad integration for your Django project.

Since Gumroad banned me (for the reasons I don't understand) I decided to at least share the code I used to integrate Gumroad payments with my Django.


## Installation

Just copypaste the gumroad folder to your Django project (imagine like you wrote all these files by yourself). You can read more details about creating Django apps [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/).

I know that there is a way to install Django app with a link to GitHub repo. Feel free to add the tutorial on how to do this. PRs welcome.
